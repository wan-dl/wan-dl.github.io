xcrun 是 macOS 上的一个命令行工具，用于在命令行中执行 Xcode 开发工具链中的各种工具和实用程序，而无需直接指定其完整路径。这使得在终端中更轻松地调用和管理 Xcode 相关的工具。

**下面将介绍使用xcrun simctl对iOS模拟器进行操作。**

## 查看iOS模拟器列表

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
```

获取所有的设备（包含真机)

```shell
xcrun xctrace list devices
```

## 启动模拟器

```bash
xcrun simctl boot <UDID>

open -a simulator
```

## 关闭模拟器

```bash
xcrun simctl shutdown <UDID>
```

## 重置模拟器

```bash
xcrun simctl erase <UDID>
```

## 清理不可用的模拟器

> 当Mac空间不够用时，这条命令或许可以帮你重获不是磁盘空间。
```bash
xcrun simctl delete unavailable
```

## 切换主题模式

```bash
# 浅色主题
xcrun simctl ui <UDID> appearance dark

# 深色主题
xcrun simctl ui <UDID> appearance light
```

## 截图

> booted代表当前启动的模拟器；也可指定模拟器<UDID>

```bash
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot xxx.png

xcrun simctl io <UDID> screenshot xxx.png
```


## 录制模拟器视频

> 在终端按Ctrl+C来停止录屏.
```
xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo test.mp4
```

## 启动指定应用名称

```bash
xcrun simctl launch booted <packageName>

xcrun simctl launch <UDID> <packageName>
```

## 关闭已打开的应用

```bash
xcrun simctl terminate booted <packageName>

xcrun simctl terminate <UDID> <packageName>
```

## 设置或清除状态栏

```bash
// 设置时间
xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --time 00:00

// 设置电量为50
xcrun simctl status_bar booted override --batteryLevel 50

// 清除修改
xcrun simctl status_bar booted clear
```

## 隐私授权

```bash
xcrun simctl privacy booted grant all <packageName> 
```

## 获取启动的模拟器UDID

```bash
xcrun simctl getenv booted SIMULATOR_UDID
```
